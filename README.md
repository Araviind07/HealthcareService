Healthcare Services API
   A simple Node.js and Express-based API for managing healthcare services. This API allows you to add, update, delete, and retrieve healthcare services from a MongoDB database. The project includes full CRUD operations for service management.

Features:
  Add a Service: Allows users to add a healthcare service by providing the name, description, and price.
  Get All Services: Retrieve a list of all available healthcare services.
  Update a Service: Modify the details of an existing service.
  Delete a Service: Remove a service from the database.
  Validation: Ensures all required fields (name, description, and price) are properly validated before storing.

Technologies Used :
  Node.js: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
  Express.js: Fast and lightweight web framework for Node.js.
  MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing services.
  Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
  dotenv: For environment variable management.
  cors: Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
  body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies
